    "Aiola’s delivery team is responsible for developing the business logic and analytic capabilities of Aiola’s artificially intelligent analyst for a new client - a large media group that operates a number of TV networks and channels. Clients like the media company are considered “low-tech”, and use traditional methods for their research, analysis, and forecasting. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our product brings on-demand analytical capabilities into their meetings, calls and chats through their client-of-choice (WhatsApp, Slack, Teams), offering insights on their data and generating reports  – wherever they work, Aiola is available. \n",
    "\n",
    "The delivery team is working on the initial skill package, the first set of capabilities that the virtual analyst will provide, automating some of the media company’s data analysis processes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The skills that are in development use internal data from the client, the dataset has information about advertisers and their brands, and details about the advertisements they purchased. The client has also provided the delivery with team with publicly available data on other networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "The delivery team is working on three skills that the media company’s innovation director determined would have a significant impact on their internal users:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Audience penetration and frequency analysis where penetration is the percentage of product category users among the show viewers and frequency is the number of times the show viewers purchase a product of this category per month, on average, and a joint score calculation. The skill calculates and visualizes the category or categories' performance among the top scored shows' viewers. Note: the skill displays information relevant to shows which advertise the category, for example, tobacco products are not relevant to childrens shows. \n",
    " - Category investment analysis, where a weighted investment score is calculated, comparing the investment in a particular show to investments across all programs, and a visualization of the difference between the weighted score and actual investment in the show per category.   \n",
    " - A dynamic bi-weekly snapshot generated from the client's updated data, showing investments of brands and advertisers in specific shows and across networks.  \n",

    "Below you will find several questions about this use case and the example skills."

    "Yes, few dimentions and also few modifications. (1st skill) - I would add an additional factor to the scoring calculation which will be the amount of viewers, which could be converted to the amount of potential customers. this could indicate the potential of sales dues to advertising. also, it could better help the company adress the right timeframes/slots to the right customers, based on the amount of potential conversions. (2nd skill) - I would reccomand to add a few dimentionals to this essence of analysis. those will include date and time dimention. these could better light on the attractibility of each program to the customers, side by \"pricing\" its date & time better, in order to better light on the more desired date & time frames, programs or the combinations of these two. (3rd skill) - On this analysis, I would recommend to add a \"shadow\" to the graph, showing the diffrence between the current results of it and the yearly-average/last results before these/else. this could indicate any change and/or trend that is starting/already happening."
